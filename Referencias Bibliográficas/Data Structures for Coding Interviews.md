> Trees consist of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect them. Unlike the linear data structures that we have studied so far, trees are hierarchical. They are similar to Graphs, except that a **cycle** cannot exist in a Tree - they are **acyclic**. In other words, there is always exactly one path between any two nodes.

> In graph theory, an N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. It is also sometimes known as a k-way tree, a k-ary tree, or an M-ary tree. A binary tree is a special case where k=2. They can have a maximum of **2** child nodes and a minimum of **0** child nodes. Binary trees are used extensively in a plethora of important algorithms!

>A _complete binary tree_ is a binary tree in which all the levels of the tree are fully filled, except for perhaps the last level which can be filled from left to right. The total number of nodes in a complete binary tree can be expressed as:

> A **full** or **proper** Binary Tree has the following characteristics:
>  -  Every node has **0** or **2** children. No node can have 1 child.
>  -  The total number of nodes in a Full Binary Tree of height **‘h’** can be expressed as:

> A Binary Tree is said to be _perfect_ if it is both full and complete. Also, note that:
>  The total number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height **‘h’**, is given as: 2(h+1)−1
>  -   The total number of leaf nodes are given as 2^{h} or \frac{(n+1)}{2}2hor2(n+1)​

> A binary tree is height-balanced if, for each node in the tree, the difference between the height of the right subtree and the left subtree is, at most, one.
