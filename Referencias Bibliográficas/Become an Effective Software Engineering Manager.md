## Snapshots

This is your first week as a manager, but with time you’ll be able to form your own independent view of your team. You’ll know how they are performing, the direction of their work in the future, and the individuals themselves. However, since you’ve just started, you’re going to have to do some investigative work. At any given time, there are three views of the team that you can compare and contrast. They can be used to discover areas you can work on right away.

## Key observation areas[](https://www.educative.io/courses/become-an-effective-engineering-manager/m2A1PyO73Dr#Key-observation-areas)

-   **_Your own observations:_** This includes what you see day in and day out when working with your team. However, you’ve only just started, so you’ll need to rely on others while you form your own view.
-   **_Your manager’s observations:_** Your manager will be interested in your performance, which fundamentally is your team’s performance. What do they think about your team and why?
-   **_Your team’s observations:_** This actually consists of each team member’s views, but we’ll group them into one for simplicity. How do they feel about themselves and their colleagues? How do they feel as part of the wider company?

## Meeting with team members

1.  You’ll want them to describe what the team is responsible for and what they are currently working on.
    
2.  You’ll also want to invite their opinion about what they like about the team and what is going well compared to what they currently find most challenging and needs improving.

For example, you will likely find out:

-   Details of the current project(s) and how clear their objectives are
-   Knowledge, or confusion (!), about who is accountable for particular decisions, such as the priority of work and the roadmap
-   How they feel about their job
-   How they feel that their team is perceived within the department and the company
-   Their enthusiasm for their current project and what they like and dislike about it

## Breaking the ice

-   How’s your week going?
-   What are you working on at the moment?
-   What was the last thing that the team shipped that you were really proud of?
-   What would you say the team is primarily responsible for?
-   How are your teammates doing?
-   What’s your favorite thing about working here?
-   What about your least favorite?
-   What’s the one thing that nobody wants to speak up about?
-   What’s something that you think I could help you with?

 Ranging from communication to stress, interpersonal issues, and beyond. These are great starting points for you to start contributing to make their experience at work better. Make sure you’re capturing the key themes using a notebook, laptop, or whatever you choose.
