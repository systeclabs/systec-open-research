Before we see some sorting algorithms, let’s visit binary search, which requires the array being searched to be already sorted. Binary search has the advantage that it takes only O(lg n) time to search an n-element array.

To shift the books by Swift and Tolstoy, we first compare the author name Tolstoy with Scott. Finding that Tolstoy comes after Scott, we shift the book by Tolstoy one slot to the right, from slot 4 to slot 5. Then we compare the author name Swift with Scott. Finding that Swift comes after Scott, we shift the book by Swift one slot to the right, from slot 3 to slot 4, which was vacated when we shifted the book by Tolstoy. Next we compare the author name Herman Melville with Scott. This time, we find that Melville does not come after Scott. At this point, we stop comparing author names, because we have found that the book by Scott should be to the right of the book by Melville and to the left of the book by Swift. We can put the book by Scott into slot 3, which was vacated when we shifted the book by Swift.

Even if you don’t consider yourself a computer insider, computer algorithms matter to you. After all, unless you’re on a wilderness expedition without a GPS, you probably use them every day. Did you search for something on the Internet today? The search engine you used—whether it was Google, Bing, or any other search engine—employed sophisticated algorithms to search the Web and to decide in which order to present its results. Did you drive your car today? Unless you’re driving a classic vehicle, its on-board computers made millions of decisions, all based on algorithms, during your trip. I could go on and on.

As an end user of algorithms, you owe it to yourself to learn a little bit about how we design, characterize, and evaluate algorithms. I assume that you have at least a mild interest, since you have picked up this book and read this far. Good for you! Let’s see if we can get you up to speed so that you can hold your own at your next cocktail party in which the subject of algorithms comes up.2

> A broad answer would be “a set of steps to accomplish a task.” You have algorithms that you run in your everyday life. You have an algorithm to brush your teeth: open the toothpaste tube, pick up your toothbrush, squeeze toothpaste onto the brush until you have applied enough to the brush, close the tube, put the brush into one quadrant of your mouth, move the brush up and down for N seconds, etc. If you have to commute to a job, you have an algorithm for your commute. And so on.
